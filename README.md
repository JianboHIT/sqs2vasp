# sqs2vasp
A python3 code to convert bestsqs.out generated by mcsqs (ATAT) to POSCAR file for VASP.

## Requirements:
- python3
- numpy

## Usage:
Convert the sqsfile (default: `bestsqs.out`) to POSCAR format (POSCAR.sqs) :
```
python3 sqs2vasp.py [ name_of_sqsfile ]
```
We can also add the execute permission for the script with the following command,
```
chmod +x sqs2vasp.py
```
then the following command would have worked just as well if python3 is valid.
```
./sqs2vasp.py [ name_of_sqsfile ]
```
